function GMatrix=GMatrix_RelaDyn_Noliner(xa,x, mu)

%function returns the matrix 'G' for the CRTBP  
%with parameter mu.

%the distances


%If U is the potential for the CRTBP then this code is computing 
%the derivative of the gradient of U.  The gradient has three 
%components which we will call u1, u2, u3.  The differential of the 
%gradient is the matrix of partials of these functions.  These will 
%be denoted by u1_x, u1_y, and so forth.

%Then (as mentioned) G is the matrix of partials
